📌 Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on 51,717 restaurant records from Bangalore to uncover key drivers of customer satisfaction and rating performance.
The goal is to understand how pricing, service features, and location influence restaurant ratings using data-driven insights.

51,717 restaurants
17 original features
Cleaned and processed dataset generated for analysis
